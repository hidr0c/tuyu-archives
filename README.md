Ok so Pusu decided not to delete their music, I came up with the idea of creating a website that plays Tuyu's MVs on shuffle and loop 24/7. The website is functional for nowâ€”it's not beautiful, but it works ðŸ˜…. Next, I'll work on optimizing the repo since the entire tuyu-music playlist is about 1.8GB ðŸ’€.
# Little checklist:
- [ ] Redesign the UX/UI.
- [ ] Display song titles in Kanji.
- [ ] Create a playback icon.
- [ ] <s> Add a database to remove the need for a 1.8GB repo. </s>
- [ ] Importing google drive API
- [ ] Deploy to website
