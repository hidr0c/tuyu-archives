# Tuyu archives
<s> After Pusu decided to delete every MV related to Pusu, I came up with the idea of creating a website that plays Tuyu's MVs on shuffle and loop 24/7. The website is functional for nowâ€”it's not beautiful, but it works. Next, I'll work on optimizing the repo since the entire **tuyu-music** playlist is about 1.8GB. </s>

Ok so Pusu decided not to delete their music but I will continue this project for fun
# Little checklist:
- [x] Redesign the UX/UI.
- [x] Create a playback icon.
- [x] Importing Google Drive API
- [x] Deploy to website

Now I only need to decrease API time to get songs list and improve UI then it should be good? oh and import subtitle also (because I still don't know how to do that xd)
