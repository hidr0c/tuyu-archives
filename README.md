# Tuyu archives
<s> After Pusu decided to delete every MV related to Pusu, I came up with the idea of creating a website that plays Tuyu's MVs on shuffle and loop 24/7. The website is functional for nowâ€”it's not beautiful, but it works ðŸ˜…. Next, I'll work on optimizing the repo since the entire **tuyu-music** playlist is about 1.8GB ðŸ’€. </s>

Ok so Pusu decided not to delete their music but I will continue this project for fun
# Little checklist:
- [ ] Redesign the UX/UI.
- [x] Display song titles in Kanji.
- [x] Create a playback icon.
- [ ] <s> Add a database to remove the need for a 1.8GB repo. </s>
- [ ] Importing Google Drive API
- [ ] Deploy to website
