# Tuyu archives
After Pusu decided to delete every MV related to Pusu, I came up with the idea of creating a website that plays Tuyu's MVs on shuffle and loop 24/7. The website is functional for nowâ€”it's not beautiful, but it works ðŸ˜…. Next, I'll work on optimizing the repo since the entire tuyu-music playlist is about 1.8GB ðŸ’€.
# Little checklist:
[] Redesign the UX/UI.
[] Display song titles in Kanji.
[] Create a playback icon.
[] Add a database to remove the need for a 1.8GB repo.
